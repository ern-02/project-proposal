# What and Why?

AirTrack is an app designed to handle the nitty-gritty of travel organization, specifically involving long-distance travel, airplanes as a base.

In the current day, booking a plane ticket should ideally be a single step. The customer enters their payment information, the confirmation is sent to them, and all they need to do is go to the airport and check into their flight.

The reality is that there are multiple factors that can complicate a user's experience. A flight is delayed last minute, but the email notification is sent to the customer's junk folder. An airline requires the customer to check in 24 hours before their flight, but due to a customer's busy schedule, they forget and are stuck in the back of the flight as a consequence. 

AirTrack aims to streamline these problems. The primary goal is to establish a database of airline companies, their policies, and their real-time flights in order to give a user a streamlined hub of updates regarding their flight. Gate information, alarms for deadlines, and alerts with relevant updates, all in one place.

# For Whom?

This is designed for airport travelers, specifically travelers with busy schedules and with shorter attention spans who can't afford to constantly monitor the status of their flight. In all honesty, this is an app that I personally would love. I've often found myself in a position where either an email about a flight delay gets buried in my inbox, or I forget about the checkin time and end up at the bottom of the list. The goal of this app, as stated before, is to streamline all these different notifications into a single app. Instead of having to parse through your inbox or set alarms yourself, have one point of contact to give you the information you need, at a single swipe.

# How?

As mentioned earlier, the app would contain a list of airline companies and airports. The user would enter the details of their flight, including flight number, airline, and airport.

Depending on the airline, AirTrack could then set alarms for the user for relevant deadlines, such as checking in, when to start, etc. And if the flight experiences a delay, the app then notifies the user, both with an immediate notification and as a lingering message on the app.

# Scope

For a team of 4-6 programmers, the project would resemble a prototype, with a set of roughly <10 airlines and <5 airports. The main work would involve two phases - one phase to build the database and implement real time tracking of flights on the airports stored. The second phase would be to hone in the real-time aspect of the app - alarm setting, tracking updates from the airport and airlines, and polishing. 

Once the prototype is polished and working, we have room to add more to the database, increasing scope of airports to something more cross-country, even global.
